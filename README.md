The background dynamically changes based on the weather condition, providing a visually appealing experience.
#Functionality:
The user can input a city in the search bar to get real-time weather information.
Temperature units can be switched between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updates the UI accordingly.
Real-time weather conditions are visually represented by dynamic background images.
Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
